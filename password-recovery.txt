# Zero Knowledge Password Recovery

## The problem

Your Mailpile is protected by a password, without which you cannot log
in and decrypt your data.  What happens if you forget the password?
Since there is no third party with access to your data, there is no
third party who can grant access to it again.


## The solution

### Preparation

Generate two secrets:

   1. MRC (master recovery code)
   2. SRC (shared recovery code)

Both the MRC and the SRC are randomly generated passwords with at least
128 bits of entropy.

The MRC is capable of unlocking your Mailpile, but its use should
trigger an immediate password reset process.

The MRC is stored in an encrypted file (MRF, Master Recovery File),
encrypted using the SRC as a key.

The SRC is then stored, along with instructions on how to reach the
owner, in an encrypted message (the SRM, Shared Recovery Message). The
SRM is encrypted (but not sent) to a 3rd party we trust to participate
in good faith in this process.


### Password recovery process

When the user initiates password recovery, the SRM is sent to the 3rd
party. The 3rd party is then responsible for relaying the SRC back to
the owner of the Mailpile.

When the owner has received the SRC and provided it to Mailpile, the MRF
can be decrypted, revealing the MRC which grants access to Mailpile
itself.

You create two (or more) encrypted files: One contains a master recovery code, which
is essentially a randomly generated password that *also* grants access to your
Mailpile. The recovery-code is AES encrypted with a strong passphrase which
we shall call the 

The other files are encrypted messages to 3rd parties who you authorize to help
you access the data. Each of these 3rd parties will receive
