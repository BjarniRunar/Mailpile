# Welcome to Mailpile! #

## Introduction ##

Mailpile (<https://www.mailpile.is/>) is a modern, fast web-mail client
with user-friendly encryption and privacy features. The development of
Mailpile is funded by
[a large community of backers](https://www.mailpile.is/#community)
and all code related to the project is and will be released under the
AGPLv3 (an OSI approved Free Software license).

Mailpile places great emphasis on providing a clean, elegant user
interface and pleasant user experience. In particular, Mailpile aims to
make it easy and convenient to receive and send PGP encrypted or signed
e-mail.

Mailpile's primary user interface is web-based, but it also has a basic
command-line interface and an API for developers. Using web technology
for the interface allows Mailpile to function both as a local desktop
application (accessed by visiting `localhost` in the browser) or a
remote web-mail on a personal server or VPS.

The core of Mailpile is a fast search engine, custom written to deal
with large volumes of e-mail on consumer hardware. The search engine
allows e-mail to be organized using tags (similar to GMail's labels) and
the application can be configured to automatically tag incoming mail
either based on static rules or bayesian classifiers.

**A related FAQ:** Note that Mailpile is *not* a mail server. It is also
not designed for use as a large-scale hosted web-mail solution. Think of
it as an alternative to Thunderbird, not a replacement for Squirrelmail
or Zimbra.


### Project Status

We are gradually working towards a 1.0 release.

The software works well and core features are considered stable on Linux
and other Unix-like operating systems (including Mac OS); it works but
is less well tested on Windows.

Installers for Mac OS and Windows are under development, packages exist
for Debian derived distributions.

**A related FAQ:** Note that we generally do not have answers to
questions about "when" a feature or package will become available. So
there's little point asking - but by all means follow us on Twitter or
follow our blog and we'll let you know when there is news!


### Trying Mailpile

We have live demos up and running [on our
website](https://www.mailpile.is/demos/). If you are curious about what
Mailpile looks like, please feel free to check it out.

think it's neat, you should also check out PageKite:

[Brennan](https://brennannovak.com) joined the team in 2013 and made
this a real project (not just a toy search engine).

The original GMail team deserve a mention for their inspiring work:
wishing the Free Software world had something like GMail is what
motivated Bjarni to start working on Mailpile. We would also like to
thank Edward Snowden for inspiring us to try and make PGP usable for
journalists and everday folks!
